# The aim of this project is to make the average user's interaction with a website more efficient and intuitive.


*First- we will make a base login page- this login page has all the key login elements centered. 
*The user will be expected to follow the traditional guidelines of a login- such as a password with 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numeric etc.
*As soon as the page is opened, the start time of the session is to be noted and kept in a variable.    
*Once the user has completed a login, the time taken to login will be calculated.
*This value will be presented to the user.
*This is to be repeated for the other traditional layouts of the login page as well: topLeft, and topRight.

*At the end, we will use our modified and efficient edition of the login.
*This page will position the div element carrying the login block exactly where the mouse cursor is, at the time of starting the website.
*Doing so, should significantly decrease the time taken to login, by the user.
*I intend to conduct a survey to idenitfy the responses of the users of this page, to identify the extent to which it improved the
user experience.

# An example of an efficient Login system, where the input areas appear exactly where the mouse is placed.

*This project is to be further expanded to identify the 'usage signature' of the user of the webpage.
*The mission is to give a website the ability to re-adjust all the components of the webpage automatically,
based on the user's usage signature, to significantly improve the user experience.
*The idea is that different people tend to access different pieces of information as soon as they enter a website.
*For example, one user may access github and may immediately go to the repositories page.
*Wheras, another user may immediately go to their profile.
*Based on the usage activity on the page, I will try to readjust the content of the page so that usually preferred items may be shown first.
